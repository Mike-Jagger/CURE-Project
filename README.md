# PORJECT OVERVIEW
## About
The CURE project involves developing machine learning models to classify real-world data. The project is detailed across several deliverables, each requiring tasks such as data creation, graphical data analysis, coding, interpretation, and model development. Specific tasks included exploring datasets like breast_cancer in sklearn, with 30 features and two classes (malignant or benign) , graphical analysis of features such as mean radius, perimeter, and area , and the creation of a machine learning model to diagnose cancer conditions .

## Key Aspects
A key part of the project was the application of descriptive statistics and machine learning classification techniques . The deliverables showcased the use of Python for data analysis and the construction of various types of graphs to understand data distributions and relationships between features . The team successfully built a model with parameters such as a k-value of 3 and a MinMaxScalar for preprocessing, achieving over 96% accuracy on test data .

## Contributions
Members of Group 103, including myself, contributed to various aspects of the project, ranging from initial data analysis to final model testing and interpretation of results . The final deliverable included a presentation of our findings, demonstrating the ability to classify new instances within the dataset and confirming the model's ability to predict whether a car was made overseas or in America based on attributes like make, top speed, and price .
